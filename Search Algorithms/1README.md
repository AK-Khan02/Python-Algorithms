# Search Algorithms

## About
This folder contains a comprehensive collection of search algorithms, showcasing a variety of approaches to solving search problems in computer science. Each algorithm is implemented in Python and serves as a practical reference for understanding different search strategies and their applications.

## Algorithms Included

### A* Search
- **File**: `A* Search.py`
- **Description**: A* Search is a best-first search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to one (or more) goal nodes. It employs heuristics to optimize the search process, making it more efficient than traditional graph search algorithms by reducing the number of nodes explored.

### Bellman-Ford
- **File**: `Bellman-Ford.py`
- **Description**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted graph. It is capable of handling graphs with negative weight edges and can detect negative weight cycles.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **File**: `Breadth First Search.py`
- **Description**: BFS is a traversing algorithm that starts from a selected node (source) and explores all of its neighbouring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly useful for searching a tree or graph data structure.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **File**: `Depth First Search.py`
- **Description**: DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at a selected node (root) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **File**: `Dijkstra's Algorithm.py`
- **Description**: Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It computes the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in the graph.

### Floyd-Warshall
- **File**: `Floyd-Warshall.py`
- **Description**: The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a dynamic programming approach to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles). It computes the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.

### Binary Search
- **File**: `binary search.py`
- **Description**: Binary Search is a fast search algorithm that works on the principle of divide and conquer. It is used to search for a specific element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Interpolation Search
- **File**: `interpolation search.py`
- **Description**: Interpolation search is an improved variant of binary search that works on the principle of interpolation and may achieve better performance for uniformly distributed data sets.

### Jump Search
- **File**: `jump search.py`
- **Description**: Jump Search is a searching algorithm for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer elements by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements.

### Linear Search
- **File**: `linear search.py`
- **Description**: Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that involves looking at every element in a sequence until the desired element is found. It is practical for small data sets.
